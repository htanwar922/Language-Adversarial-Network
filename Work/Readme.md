Download (Upload) the files to Google Drive folder Colab Notebooks:

The directories should be:
'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/'
Copy the files extract_data.ipynb and LAN_v3.ipynb in this folder.

In that two directories get created after running extract_data.ipynb (you can create yourself if you prefer):

> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/Amazon reviews/'

>> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/Amazon reviews/train'

>> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/Amazon reviews/dev'

>> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/Amazon reviews/test'

> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/bwe/'

>> 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Work/bwe/vectors'

Next run the LAN_v3.ipynb and wait!!

If the files are copied to some other folder instead, you may have to modify the top cells in both the files accordingly.
After running the first cells, click the link generated and enter the authorization code for same drive from which the files are being run.

In extract_data.ipynb, you can select which language datas and word-embeddings to download.
